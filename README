Please use 'develop' branch as the basis for development. Create lots of feature or bugfix branches and merge back to 'develop' branch. Use 'git merge --no-ff' to leave a trail.

Setup data monitoring with Graphite:
- Install Graphite independently
- Find storage-schemas.conf and use Xen VMs config in Graphite
- Copy celeryconfig.py.example to celeryconfig.py and modify properly
- Have a running Redis server
- Run celeryd and celerybeat
- Confirm data can be imported into Graphite
- Configure supervisord to start the processes (change .conf and .sh files accordingly)
